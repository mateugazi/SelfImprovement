# SelfImprovement
This repo is for collecting materials from which I learned or I plan to learn in the future. I'm mostly interested in TypeScript both on Backend and Frontend. Currently I'm focusing on learning NestJS and becoming more conscious on topics like SOLID, clean code and DomainDrivenDesign in order to become a better developer.
