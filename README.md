# SelfImprovement
This repo is for collecting materials from which I learned or I plan to learn in the future. I am mostly interested in TypeScript both on Backend and Frontend. Currently I am focusing on learning NestJS and becoming more conscious on topics like SOLID, clean code and Domain Driven Design to become a better developer.

The way this repo is organised was inspired by this repo https://github.com/nowakprojects/SelfImprovement
